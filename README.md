This is a React project made by me to practice my concepts of State, props and useEffect hooks.
Do not focus on the Styling / CSS as that is not the main objective of this project.
You can find and try out the project here - https://meme-generator-six-sable.vercel.app/

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
